            <h1>What's the purpose of education?</h1>
            <p>
                Education is one of the vital segments for a person's prosperity. It
                can shape one's life the correct way. Instruction is a cycle of
                conferring or obtaining information, fostering the forces of thinking
                and judgment. It plans oneself or others mentally to develop life. It
                improves the individual existence of individuals as well as their
                local area. No one can disregard the meaning of Education throughout
                everyday life and society.

            <h1>What happens without education?</h1>
            <p>
                The competitive world has made it thin and slim to succeed without education. Education is a vital
                weapon to conquer the world. The competitive market dynamics prove it difficult and strenuous for
                individuals without education. It is the most basic critical aspect of a person's life. Primarily,
                education is essential just like air and food. Education is the most fundamental aspect of a successful
                person and a healthy mind. Without education, no progress can be realized in life. Illiteracy is
                associated with backwardness. Critical decision-making processes are founded on education and whatever
                we had gathered from the previous knowledge and experience. Precisely, life without education is
                imprisonment and intolerable. Handling social challenges and problems need proper education and
                literacy.

            <h1>What's role of school in education?</h1>
            <p>
                Education is a weapon to improve one's life. It is likely the main
                apparatus to completely change one. Schooling for a youngster starts
                at home. It is a long-lasting interaction that finishes with death.
                Education positively decides the nature of a person's life. Schooling
                improves one's information, abilities and fosters character and
                demeanor. Education influences the odds of work for individuals.
                School is the basic foundation of knowledge being imparted to a child.
                It gives a chance to children to acquire knowledge on various fields
                of education.

            <h1>What role we play in education?</h1>
            <p>
                Our shool education must focus on the following aspects, which
                contribute immensely to the development of the young minds as they
                step into adulthood for the bright future:
            </p>
            <ul type="1">
                <li>
                    <span>Mental Aspect:</span>School is the foremost fountain of
                    knowledge children are exposed to. It gives a chance for them to
                    acquire knowledge on various fields. This contributes to cultivation
                    in the thought process. When one is exposed to the influences coming
                    from various cultural sources, his/her on world and existence
                    becomes vast.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Social Aspect:</span>School is the first avenue of socialising
                    for a child. Up till then, parents and immediate family members are
                    the only people the child has human interactions with. And
                    familiarity is a breeding ground of stagnancy. With schools,
                    children are exposed not only to new ideas but also to same aged
                    compatriots. This instills sociable practices such as empathy,
                    friendship, participation, assistance which turn out to be important
                    in their adulthood.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Physical Aspects:</span>A child, after conception, goes
                    through various physical development. While home provides a
                    restricted outlet, in school, a child can channelise his energy into
                    more sociable avenues. Studies have pointed out that while in
                    familiar environment, the child is equipped to deal with sudden
                    bursts of energy, the learns to be at his/her best behaviour only
                    when exposed to same-aged individuals. Also, the presence of
                    activities such as sports, craft help children direct their
                    boundless energy into something productive.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Overall Development:</span>Earlier, schools were considered as
                    places to learn events in history chapter, solve tough mathematical
                    problems or recite poems and sonnets. In the current educational
                    scenario, a child learns to go beyond the traditional way of rote
                    learning. They are taught to develop a mind of their own and through
                    the flexible curriculum, curiosity is promoted. The child is freed
                    from the shackles of mental blocks and lets his/her imagination run
                    its course.
